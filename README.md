1. I would fit my automated tested within a Github action taht runs whenever code is pushed. That way this whole process is automated for me, and I dont need to spend time manually running test cases myself. The automated unit test will tell me what goes right and wrong.


2. No, because end-to-end deals with more about user interactivity rather than if a function is working correctly or incorrectly.

3. The difference between navigation mode and snapshot mode is that navigation mode looks at a website in a time horizon, capturing what a user might do in a website to understand its gaps in a site whereas snapshot mode only checks one instance in time to check for issues regarding the website's design.

4. Based on the Lighthouse results, we notice our performacne is suffering. We can make images less pixelated to reduce the latency. To further reduce the latency, we can lower the amount of Javascript DOM in our code. Finally, we may make our site more simplistic and less complicated to further lower the latency.
